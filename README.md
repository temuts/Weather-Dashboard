# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The Weather Dashboard is a website where users can search up real-time weather of cities around the world! 

## Installation
The website can be accessed on any browser by inputting the URL for the deployed site into the address bar. Once on the page, they will input the city they would like to search in the search bar. 

## Usage
Once the website can be accessed through the deployed site URL, the user will see that the page is empty. They will navigate to the search bar on the top left of the page to search the city for which they would like to retrieve weather information. This information is then presented in the green bar: the city name, an icon to represent the weather state, the "Feels like" temperature in Celsius, the wind in miles per hour, and the Humidity in percentage form. 

The deployed page will look like this:
